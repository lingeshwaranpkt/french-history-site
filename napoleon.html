   <h2>Napoleon’s Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>Following the chaos of the French Revolution, Napoleon emerged as a brilliant military leader. He seized power in 1799 and declared himself Emperor by 1804. He reformed the legal system (Napoleonic Code), expanded education, and centralized administration.</p>

    <h2>Battle of Waterloo (1815)</h2>
    <p>After a brief exile to Elba, Napoleon returned to power in 1815 during the “Hundred Days.” His final defeat came at the Battle of Waterloo, where combined British and Prussian forces stopped him. He was exiled again, this time to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.</p>

    <h2>Napoleon’s Legacy</h2>
    <p>Despite his defeat, Napoleon’s reforms modernized France and influenced legal systems worldwide. His life remains a symbol of ambition, genius, and the risks of unchecked power.</p>
