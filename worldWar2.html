    <h2>Invasion and Occupation</h2>
<p>Germany invaded France in 1940, forcing it to surrender within six weeks. Northern France was occupied, while the south was governed by the Vichy regime â€” a puppet government collaborating with the Nazis.</p>

<h2>Resistance and Liberation</h2>
<p>The French Resistance fought through sabotage, intelligence, and aiding Allied forces. Charles de Gaulle led the Free French Forces from exile. France was finally liberated in 1944 after D-Day and Allied advances.</p>

<h2>Post-War France</h2>
<p>WWII reshaped France politically and socially. The Vichy legacy remained controversial, while the Resistance became a source of pride. The country focused on rebuilding and joined efforts for European unity.</p>
