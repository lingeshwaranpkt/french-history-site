    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Joan of Arc was a peasant girl who became a national heroine of France. She played a crucial role during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her faith and military leadership helped the French regain territories from English occupation.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) was a series of conflicts fought between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, each vying for control of territories and the French throne.</p>

    <h2>Joan's Role</h2>
    <p>At just 17, Joan convinced Charles VII to allow her to lead French troops. She had a series of military successes, including the lifting of the siege of Orléans, which helped turn the tide of the war in favor of the French.</p>
