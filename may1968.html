    <h2>Origins of the Revolt</h2>
<p>In May 1968, students at Paris universities protested against outdated education, rigid authority, and capitalism. Their demands included university reforms, free speech, and more personal freedoms.</p>

<h2>Nationwide Uprising</h2>
<p>The protests spread across France, leading to massive strikes involving over 10 million workers. The country was nearly paralyzed. President Charles de Gaulle briefly fled the country before regaining control.</p>

<h2>Impact on French Society</h2>
<p>Though the protests were eventually quelled, they brought lasting change. Education reforms, worker rights, and modern attitudes toward authority were influenced by the movement. It remains a symbol of youth rebellion and societal transformation.</p>
